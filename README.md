Artificial neural networks (neural networks) are inspired by biological structures like the brain. Basically they are consisting of nodes (neurons) and edges (vectors). The goal is to extract information from the input values and generate output values like predictions, pattern or structures not evident in the input values. The information inputs are transformed on the path through networks with matrice multiplications and activation functions. This makes deep learning networks as a special type of neural networks capable to handle non-linear data.

The simplest models are the perceptron and the feedforward neural network. Based on those models with increasing complexity are developed adding more connections and hidden layers to the network. This project is focusing on the principal components and techniques of neural network. Then sklearn is applied develop network models to make predictions on synthetically created data. Some of techniques applied here are
